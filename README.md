# Preview: 
You can find our project showcased with the New York Junior Academy of the Sciences (https://www.nyas.org/program-category/junior-academy/), where we won first out of 142 participating teams in the Cognitive Challenges. This project is sponsored by NEOM, and we are trying to get in contact for integration. Otherwise, feel free to use any it. 
There is a video of the demo in practice working (real-time proof of product and concept) at our presentation. We are still working on it, but you can find the canva at [https://www.canva.com/design/DAF5YyDOnU8/ZZcG02mAjOyL51ecjP75dg/edit?utm_content=DAF5YyDOnU8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF5YyDOnU8/ZZcG02mAjOyL51ecjP75dg/edit)

# Task at Hand
## Problem Statement: 

The world is grappling with a profound learning crisis. Children have an inalienable right to education. UN estimates 250+ million children do not have so. Even those who are receiving an education, might not have the best resources. 

Factors like extreme poverty, lack of resources, child labor, and discrimination affect people who have different strengths, weaknesses, backgrounds, and styles. In rural India, where nearly three-quarters of third graders struggle with basic two-digit subtraction problems. (World Bank Research)

Poor Personalized Experience, Shortage of teachers, Infrastructure, or Logistical constraints. Individual issues also come into play. Individuals eager to learn outside of schools also don’t have many methods available to them, and students of different capacities are forced to learn in the same environment.

People are not robots: Rigid, one-size-fits-all teaching falls short.  In the general population, the distribution of the three learning styles is 65% visual, 30% auditory, and 5% kinesthetic. (NIH US Government Survey)


## Solution:
We designed an AI-powered educational application that revolutionizes education for both teachers and students

Link to app prototype: (https://www.figma.com/proto/kZauDGMB0pctK5vKGCebav/AI4Access?type=design&node-id=431-32&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=431%3A32).

### Teacher:
Personalized Curriculum: 
AI analysis of different learner profiles of all students (on the basis of their test scores, attentiveness in class, attendance etc.) Teacher is then given personalized teaching plan to adhere to learning types/disabilities, strengths/weaknesses of the students
Students can be grouped into separate classes on the basis of their learning types/strengths to ensure more cohesive learning environment.


Student Attention/Attendance:
Computer Vision - tracks student attendance and attention span in class; Aids teacher in judging student performance accurately, and divert attention to certain students/topics where and when required.

Testing Analysis:
Assessment analysis provided to the teacher. 
Data to be used for further personalization of curriculums.
Helps teacher with student feedback and further gaining an insight into student responses to the curriculum.
Assessment data will be analyzed to show which topics which students need help with and focus on them accordingly.

3D Models and Live Simulations using AR/VR:
This would be a common feature for teachers to utilize in the classroom while teaching, as well as a feature each student would be able to access using their devices.


### Student: 
Personalized Learning:
Analyze the student’s learning style, such as visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or mixed, using data from their interactions with the learning materials and activities. Recommend exercises, resources and explanations on the basis of this information.

Assessment Analysis:
To provide personalized learning experiences, it is important to understand the student’s current level of knowledge, skills, and interests. This can be done by using quizzes, assessments, and feedback mechanisms that measure the student's prior knowledge, and learning outcomes. 

Accessibility & Inclusivity:
Students with learning disabilities are supported by visualized learning experiences.
Leverage technologies such as augmented reality (AR) interactive media to create immersive and 3D models on demand that better explain concepts, especially for visual and kinesthetic learners. E.g. AR/VR science labs to perform experiments.

Communication:
Anonymous real-time doubt-solving feature where doubts are clarified in the classroom via text in the following ways in a classroom. Thsis is to ensure that students are able to ask questions without the fear of being judged by their peers.
Firstly, an AI model would be utilized to clarify a student's doubts. 
Further, if the doubt persists : A peer or fellow student will clarify a student's doubt anonymously using our app. 
Finally if the doubt persists: A teacher would clarify a student's doubt anonymously using our app.
